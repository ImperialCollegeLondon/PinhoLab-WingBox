# PinhoLab - WingBox

![Exploded rendered view of the wing-box model inspired on the Airbus A350](./graphics/exploded.png)

:bulb: This is very large wing-box finite element model inspired on the Airbus A350XWB. It was built from publicly availble materials and is intended for research purposes only. The model was built as a test bed for our [high performance material modelling framework based on Abaqus user subroutines.](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/hpmscmmf)

## Repository organisation

- *Model L1 - full wing* - contains the Abaqus input files for the full wing model (***15M DoFs, 2.7M elements***);

![The wingbox model](./graphics/wing_transparent.png)

- *Model L2 - intermediate assembly* - contains the Abaqus input files for the intermediate assembly model of the critical region of the wingbox;

- *Model L3 - stringer run out detail* - contains the Abaqus input files for the stringer run out detail model;

- *Model L4 - stringer web detail* - contains the Abaqus input files for the stringer web detail model;

- *damage initiation input files* - example files for the damage initiation analysis using [this codebase](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/hpmscmmf)
- *damage evolution input files* - example files for the damage evolution analysis using [this codebase](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/hpmscmmf)


## Requirements

- Abaqus 2019+
- [HPMSCMMF user subroutines](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/hpmscmmf) (for damage initiation and evolution analysis)
